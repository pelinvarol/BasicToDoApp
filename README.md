# To Do App
This is a simple ***To-Do-App*** app using Flutter. The application consists of a single page.

The application is based on orange and its tones.

 - When the user opens the application for the first time, he/she
   encounters a blank screen with the text 'My To Do List' at the top
   and a plus button at the bottom right.
 -   When the plus button is clicked, a section comes to add task. There is a placeholder here, the user can write the task to this place. The user can add the task by clicking **'Save**' button and the task will be added to the task list. 
 - If the user presses **'Cancel'** button, the task will not be added to the list and the unadded text will not be displayed when the user wants to add something again.
 - When the user ticks the checkbox on the left side of any task, the task will be completed and appears as crossed out.
 - The user can remove completed tasks from the to do list. If the user **swipes left** on any task, the trash icon will appear and when it is clicked, the task will be deleted from the list.
 - In the application, the data is **kept in memory** and when the user closes the application and runs it again, it displays the list as the last one left.
